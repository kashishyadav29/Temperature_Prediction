# 🌡️ Temperature Prediction using Humidity | Linear Regression
# A simple machine learning project to predict temperature based on humidity using Linear Regression. The dataset includes sensor readings such as humidity, pressure, and # geographic location. This project demonstrates basic EDA, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Python and scikit-learn.

# 🔧 Features:
# -> Data cleaning and preprocessing
# -> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# -> Linear Regression model training
# -> Model evaluation (MSE, R²)
# -> Visualization of prediction results

# 📊 Tech Stack:
# -> Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
# -> Juypter Notebook
